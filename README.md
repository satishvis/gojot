OK. But, really, *gojot* is just a fancy wrapper for `git`, `gpg` and `vim` that allows you to make time-stamped entries to encrypted documents while keeping the entire document synchronized in it a `git` repository.

Install
=======

First make sure you have `gpg`, `git`, and `vim` installed:

``` sourceCode
$ sudo apt-get install gpg git vim
```

Then you can install gojot using `go get`:

``` sourceCode
$ go get github.com/schollz/gojot
```

Usage
=====

First-time use
--------------

For the first time setup, just use:

    gojot

If you do not have any GPG keys you should first generate one with:

    gpg --gen-key
